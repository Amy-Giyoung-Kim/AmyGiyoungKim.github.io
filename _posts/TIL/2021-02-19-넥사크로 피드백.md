### 💪 Things to do

Got a feedback from Nexacro

### 📚Feedback

(1) Folder should be well organised before project started

(2) If you use few pop-up, it should individually have an ID 

(3) ChildFrame should included 'init'

(4) For using 'fn_callback', it has to include id,args,ErrMsg

<ex: 'this.fn_callback = function(id,args,ErrMsg)'>

### 📢 Plan for tomorrow OR a week

- Front page needs to change
